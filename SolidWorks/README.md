# Crane Hook Project

## Overview
This repository contains the development of a crane hook. It includes design files, technical documentation, and other resources related to the project.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to enhance my skills in mechanical design, material science, and engineering by:
- Designing and building a functional crane hook.
- Implementing structural analysis and ensuring safety standards.
- Experimenting with different materials to optimize strength and durability.

## Project Structure

- **CAD Models**: 3D models of the crane hook components created using [software name, e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360].
- **Code**: Control algorithms and software used for crane hook operation (if applicable).
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications, design documentation, and assembly instructions.
- **Testing**: Results and data from tests and validation, including load-bearing analysis and stress tests.
