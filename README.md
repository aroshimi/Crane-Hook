# Crane Hook Project

## Overview
This project is my second endeavor in mechanical design, focusing on the development of a crane hook. The crane hook is an essential component used in lifting and transporting heavy loads safely. This project highlights my growth in design skills and emphasizes mechanical design, materials selection, and testing to ensure the hook meets safety and performance standards.

## Features
- **Robust Design**: Engineered to handle heavy loads while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Material Selection**: Utilizes high-strength materials for durability and reliability.
- **Safety Standards**: Complies with industry safety regulations.
- **Modular Components**: Easily customizable for different applications.

## Usage
- All project files will be available in the repository for review and modification.
- Follow the guidelines in the documentation for assembly and safety checks.
- Conduct load tests to ensure the hook operates within its design parameters.

## Testing
- Description of testing procedures and results.
- Include data on load capacity and performance metrics.
